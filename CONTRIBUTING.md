### Suggesting Enhancements
- We love new ideas! Whether it's a new career path or a UI improvement, feel free to open an issue to discuss it.

### Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the UI remains responsive and follows the existing design language (Tailwind + Framer Motion).
4. Maintain the "Privacy First" rule: Do not add external tracking or server-side storage for user recordings.

## 🎨 Coding Guidelines
- **React**: Use functional components and hooks.
- **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS utility classes. Avoid custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.
- **Icons**: Always use the `SafeIcon` component for rendering icons from `react-icons/fi`.
- **Performance**: Keep components small (< 100 lines) and focused.

## 📝 Commit Messages
- Use clear and descriptive commit messages (e.g., `feat: add nursing career path`, `fix: timer reset bug`).
